					<h2>1st Time We Ate at Punchburger</h2>
					<p>I am 90% sure I took this pic the first time we ate at Punchburger.  Coincidentally, that would have also been the first time we went to <a href="https://www.gencon.com/">Gencon</a> together.</p>
					<figure>

						<figcaption>Blake's the one with glasses.  Ignore the other guy, he's only interesting in that he introduced me to Blake.</figcaption>

					<a name="buildings"></a>
					<h2>Blake and Some Buildings</h2>
					<p>Blake seems drawn to games involving building stuff.  In this pic, the stuff we're building is little buildings.  Is that meta?  I'm not sure.</p>
					<figure>

						<figcaption>Another photobomb by that other, non-Blake guy whom you can disregard.</figcaption>

					<a name="basement"></a>
					<h2>Blake in a Basement</h2>
					<p>This was a game about birds.  We were playing in a basement.</p>
					<figure>

						<figcaption>No distractions from the outside world when you basement-game.</figcaption>

					<a name="indulgence"></a>
					<h2>Blake Indulging Me By Playing a Game He Is Not That Into</h2>
					<p>The specific game is not that important.  The important thing is Blake was playing a game he didn't really like because he knew I wanted to try it.  Blake's cool like that.  Most of the time.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Blake Indulging Me By Playing a Game He Is Not That Into.jpg" width = "500" height = "400" alt="Blake Indulging Me By Playing a Game He Is Not That Into">
						<figcaption>The game was called 'El Dorado' in case you're looking at that pic and thinking 'Jeremy was right in this case, that game does look good.'</figcaption>
					</figure>

				<section>
					<a name="carpets"></a>
					<h2>Blake Playing a Game Involving Carpets</h2>
					<p>This game is pretty fun.  The box has dozens of little pieces of carpet you lay down as you move around a board.  That other non-Blake guy got us into this game.  One point for him, I guess.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Blake Playing a Game Involving Carpets.JPG" width = "400" height = "500" alt="">
						<figcaption>Seriously, it's a carpet game and it's fun.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="sportsball"></a>
					<h2>Blake Playing Sportsball</h2>
					<p>Blake can hoop it up a bit.  Not all of his gaming is done in basements and at conventions.  He's also pretty good with kids.  These two look like touble;  watch out, Blake!</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Blake Playing Sportsball.jpg" width = "500" height = "400" alt="">
						<figcaption>Just kidding, those are my kids and they were fine that day.  No threat to Blake.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="trees"></a>
					<h2>Blake Playing with Trees</h2>
					<p>This game, we were planting trees.  Seems like we play a lot of games based on other people's jobs.  Blake's a programmer, not a tree...planting...person.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Blake Playing with Trees.JPG" width = "500" height = "400" alt="">
						<figcaption>Botanist?  There's probably a more specific word than that.</figcaption>
					</figure>

				<section>
					<a name="cathouse"></a>
					<h2>Blake with Elbert and a Cathouse Rescued from the Alley</h2>
					<p>Blake with one of his two cats, Elbert.  Elbert is the friendly one.  Prominently featured in this picture is a gigantic cat house that somebody threw out.  Blake rescued it, and is recarpeting it.  Elbert and the other, less-friendly cat seem to really like it.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Blake with Elbert and a Cathouse Rescued from the Alley.jpg" width = "400" height = "500" alt="">
						<figcaption>I can't remember the other cat's name.  It's late, give me a break.</figcaption>

					<a name="doggame"></a>
					<h2>Playing a Game About Dogs in a Football Stadium</h2>
					<p>This is actually pretty cool.  The game was fun, but the best part was we were playing it, on a freaking football field.  Lucas Oil Stadium, if you must know.  Gencon started using the stadium as part of their event space a couple of years ago.  Pretty neat to get to walk around on it and do non-football-related-activities.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Playing a Game About Dogs in a Football Stadium.jpg" width = "500" height = "400" alt="">
						<figcaption>A lot of these pics of Blake were taken at Gencon.  There's that other guy again!</figcaption>
					</figure>

				<section>
					<a name="mintjulep"></a>
					<h2>Possibly a Mint Julep But Probably Not</h2>
					<p>This was taken at the Rock Bottom Brewery, at lunch, in Indianapolis, at *gasp* Gencon.  Blake was relaxing with some kind of drink.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Possibly a Mint Julep But Probably Not.JPG" width = "400" height = "500" alt="">
						<figcaption>It's okay, he wasn't driving.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="prototype"></a>
					<h2>Prototypical Blake</h2>
					<p>Fun fact: at Gencon, you can play prototypes of games that haven't been published yet.  This was one such game.  That guy who introduced me to Blake makes a point of signing us up for at least one prototype play every year.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Prototypical Blake.JPG" width = "500" height = "400" alt="">
						<figcaption>Some prototypes are fun but some can give you a headache.</figcaption>
					</figure>

				<section>
					<a name="threeblakes"></a>
					<h2>Three Blakes</h2>
					<p>Three Blakes ended up randomly playing a game together!  The world doesn't know how close it came to being swallowed up by some kind of giant Universal Coincidence that day.  And it must <b>never</b> know.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="Three Blakes.JPG" width = "500" height = "400" alt="">
						<figcaption>I can laugh about it now but when it happened it was terrifying.</figcaption>

				<h2>The shocking truth about Blake!</h2>
				<p>Blake's a friend of mine;  he works for LaunchCode;  he encouraged me to take this class.  He's a great guy, one of several exceptional friends I am lucky to have found here in St. Louis, including Jeremy (not me) who is the 'other guy' pictured several times above.  Jeremy also happens to be a programmer of note and has also been very encouraging as I contemplate changing careers.  Chuck, not pictured, is also a friend, also a programmer, and it was his basement that was featured in the basement paragraph above.  And I'm not stalking Blake, I just take lots of pictures every year when we go to Gencon together and I pretty much never delete any of them from my phone.</p>
